            <h2>Tributes</h2>
            <p>  I'm Brian Jones.  My wife Kitty and I were just married last winter. 
                <br> We wanted a memorable honeymoon experience, and so we looked into the excursions offered by Extreme Honeymoons.  Something I always wanted to do was bow hunt.
                  We were surprised that a cougar hunt was available the week just after we were to be married.  It was great to have all the details of this trip taken care of for us by professionals who knew just what was needed.
                  The owners even provided some archery instruction for both of us before the trip began.
             <br>
                 <br>We met our hunt leader, Tom Henry, the first day of our trip.  He runs a team of 4 hound dogs when he hunts cougars. 
                 <br> The hunt began just after a light snow, so the big cats could be tracked.  We saw three cougars that day, but were not able to get any clean shots. 
                 It was a tiring, exciting, beautiful weekend.  Thanks so much, Extreme Honeymoons, for a memorable honeymoon experience.  We are sending a couple of snapshots of our great weekend.
                 <br><br>
                 Thanks for the memories,<br>
                 Brian and Kitty Jones</p>
